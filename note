First goal: make first line of the window not scroll

Current goal: If winbar is enabled, make it not scroll

Approach:
Change RenderedWindow to animate the top line seperately.

Find out if a window have winbar via `vim.wo.winbar`

Find out if a window have border via `vim.api.nvim_win_get_config(0).border`
